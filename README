Dwarf Foreman was the original utility designed to let you change dwarf labor assignments easily. It works based off your dwarves' professions and custom professions.

Dwarf Foreman is essentially abandoned. As of this writing, Dwarf Therapist (http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/) is the recommended replacement.
